# EmailSpammer

EmailSpammer is a software to send many identical emails via an SMTP server to one replicant at once.

## Usage
Download the executable java file and run it with at least java 17: `java -jar EmailSpammer.jar`

Once `Email Spammer` is installed, you have to log in to an SMTP server. After that, the software can be used to send multiple emails.

## Limitation

- EMails can only be sent via an SMTP server
- The SMTP server must support TLS
- The SMTP server must support authentication
- No history of sent emails
- No support for attachments
- No support for HTML

**-> I might be working on these limitations at some point in time**
